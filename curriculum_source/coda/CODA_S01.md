# TITLE: Understanding Codependency (Definition & Cycle)

## FACILITATOR — OVERVIEW (5 min)
Codependency is a learned behavioral pattern where self-worth and emotional stability depend on controlling, fixing, or rescuing others. This session introduces codependency as a cycle similar to addiction and emphasizes awareness over guilt.

## FACILITATOR — OPENING (5 min)
Discussion prompts:
- What do you think codependency means?
- How does trying to control or fix others affect you?
- Where do you notice anxiety when others struggle?

## FACILITATOR — REVIEW (10 min)
Codependency is not a personality trait but a behavioral pattern. The cycle often begins with anxiety or pain and leads to control, temporary relief, resentment, and guilt.

## FACILITATOR — TEACH (20 min)
Teach the codependency cycle:
Pain/Anxiety → Control/Caretaking → Temporary Relief → Resentment/Exhaustion → Guilt → More Control.
