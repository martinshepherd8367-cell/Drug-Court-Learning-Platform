# Facilitator Specification (V1 Simplified)

## Overview
The facilitator role focuses on content delivery, attendance tracking, and takeaway verification. In V1, we have removed strict session locking in favor of open access and timestamp-based accountability.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Session Delivery
- Facilitator uses the **Three-Zone Console** to guide the class.
- **No Unlocking Required**: Participants can access the session content on their devices immediately. Facilitator does not need to press "Start" to unlock.
- **Pacing**: Facilitator advances their own view through sections. Participant views are independent (no forced sync).

### 2. Attendance Tracking
- **Check-In**: Facilitators can generate a QR code (in-person or virtual) for participants to scan.
- **Timestamping**: Attendance is recorded with a timestamp.
- **Lateness**: The system flags late arrivals based on schedule comparisons, but does not block entry.
- **Absence**: Facilitators or Admins can mark participants absent.

### 3. Makeup Assignment
- **Admin Managed**: The assignment of makeup credits is primarily an Admin function in V1.
- **Facilitator View**: Facilitators can view makeup status but do not auto-assign via "End Session".

### 4. Class Completion & Takeaways
- **Completion Metric**: "Takeaways Submitted: X / Y".
- **Privacy**: Facilitators see the *count* of submissions to gauge class readiness/engagement, but do not view participant responses in-class (to preserve flow).
- **Session End**: Clicking "End Session" stops the local timer and redirects to the dashboard. It does not lock the session for participants.
