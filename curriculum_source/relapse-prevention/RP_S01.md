# PROGRAM: Relapse Prevention
# SESSION: 1
# TITLE: Introduction to Relapse Prevention

## FACILITATOR — OVERVIEW (5 min)
Relapse prevention is a skill-building process that supports long-term recovery. Relapse is often a process that begins before substance use through changes in thinking, mood, and behavior. This session introduces early warning signs and Seemingly Unimportant Decisions (SUDs).

## FACILITATOR — OPENING (5 min)
Relapse prevention focuses on recognizing risk early and responding before escalation.
Discussion prompts:
- What does relapse prevention mean?
- Does relapse start before using?
- What small choices quietly increase risk?

## FACILITATOR — REVIEW (10 min)
Relapse is a process. Early changes in routine, thinking, and behavior matter.
SUDs are small decisions that quietly raise risk.

## FACILITATOR — TEACH (20 min)
- Relapse prevention = recognizing warning signs and acting early.
- Warning signs:
  - Thoughts: “I’m fine,” “I can handle it.”
  - Mood: irritability, restlessness, overwhelm.
  - Behavior: isolation, skipped supports, dishonesty.
- SUD examples: skipping calls, driving past old spots, isolating.
Early action beats late intensity.
